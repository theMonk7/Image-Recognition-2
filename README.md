-> Description: Data set containing images of cats and dogs


### iOS Stack: **SwiftUI**

### Steps to Create Model
1. Take the sample data-set with a parent folder containing all the N-different classes which we want to classify
2. Add images in the N-different folders immediately under parent folder
3. Create 2 such samples of parent folders, one for testing and one for training
4. Open Create ML and select Image Classifier
5. Select the training parent folder
